# Greenhouse monitoring

## Build web interface

```shell
cd www
npm install
npm run build
```

It should build the React web app and put the files in the `/www/dist` folder.

After building, copy the contents of `/www/dist` folder to the SD card in the `/www` folder. You should be able to access the interface at http://greenhouse.local.
